a. This is a basic simon says game. The object of the game is to replicate the pattern show on the screen by clicking the corresponding buttons.

b. user stories

* as a Player I can click on each of the 4 squares so that I can replicate the pattern and get a high score

* as a Player I can click on the rules tab on the home page so that I can read the rules and understand how to play the game

* as a Player I can click on the High Scores tab so that I can view all of the previous high scores

c. In the softwares current condition everything is functional, but there are still a few minor bugs. This game simple game of simon says where the goal of the game is to memorize and click the boxes in the order that they light up, which is randomly generated by the computer

d.

* as a User I can add custom images to the game so I can click on different images instead of these boring solid colored boxes

* as a User I can choose a custom set of sounds so that when I click on a box it makes a sound and it makes the game more enjoyable

* as a User I can add my name after I lose so that my name can be associated with my high score

e. The current state of the README is excellent. It includes picures of the game, explanantions of how each part of the code works and where to find such thing, and advice on where to get started on where the last group left off. There is not really anything that would improve the README at this point.

f. Yes, there are a few targets that do not currently have description. Other than that the build.xml look fairly clean and does not need much work.

g. Right now there are 7 issues, totalling 1100 points. Yes the issues are clear on terms of what they are asking, but there does not seem to be a lot of extra stuff that there could be added, meaning the game is functionally for what it is, and I am not sure at this time if there are a lot more things/issues/suggetsions that we could add related to this game

i. The code is organized decently well, but there are a few things that should be chagned. The high score files are in 3 seperate files, all only containg 1 line. I think it should be chagned to store all of the highscores in 1 file. Also all of the text files are in the home directory of the project, they should be moved into a separate folder to reduce the clutter.
The purposes of the classes/methods are clear and they are organized decently well, but they could be better. It is not organized into MVC. That being said the classes/methods are named fairly well, so there does not need to be a lot of comments to understand what is going on in the code (and where there is some ambiguity there are comments/javadoc to clear it up). For future programmer looking at this code I would say just read the README first (this does a great job of explaining everything clearly) then look at all of the classes in the /src directory. They have clear names, and if you don't see a class named what you looking for, it is still pretty easy to find it. It is not the best organized code, but it is decently easy to figure out what is going on.

j. There are Junit tests, but they are not as extensive as they should be. Also some of the testing is done in the classes themselves instead of designated test classes. It looks like they test all of the classes, but only one to a couple for most. I think there should be a few more Junit tests added to all of them to ensure everything is working correctly and to test more possible corner cases.
