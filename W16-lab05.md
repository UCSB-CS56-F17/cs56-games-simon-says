Description:
In this game, a random generator picks one of the four-six squares. The player must imitate what the random generator picks and each time the player is successful the game adds another step to the sequence.

User Stories:
Player can select new game from the main menu and begin playing the game.
Player can select new game once their game is over.
Player can select number of squares in the game.
Player can view the rules of the game.
Player can exit the applciation.

Playability:
Game can be played up to three times and then the game freezes. When the game is played the computer randomly picks squares to which the user must imitate it.

Potential Additions:
Player can select any number of squares from two to ten.
Player can choose music to go along with the game.
Player can make the squares their own personal images.
Player can choose the color of the squares.
Player has a time limit to repeat the sequence given.
Player can view high scores.

README.md:
We could add build.xml documentation to the README. Also, we can add more information on how to play the game once we implement more code to the game. A lot of the information such as instructions how to play and also something such as high scores could be put into the README instead of the game to make the game a more enjoyable experience and reduce the total amount of clutter.

Build.xml
Needs descriptions for javadoc and test so that when ant -p is typed in the command line they show up as targets. As far as we can tell, there's no legacy code in the build.xml that needs to be deleted.

Current Issues:
The current issues are clear cut, however they are all minor bug fixes and in order to get "1000 points" we would definitely have to add our own addition to the game.

Additional Issues:
The squares in amateur/intermediate mode are touching so we should look to try and fix that error. Also, "New Game" automatically creates a amateur game. We want to select a version and have it remember that version before starting the game. Or when "New Game" is selected it automatically asks what version the player wants to play.

Code Summary:
The code is split up into the various components needed to make the game work. There are classes for the buttons, although some of the classes have variables and methods that are somewhat unclear. We think that adding more comments, or possibly adjusting the names would help. Specifically in SimonSaysGame in the model folder, the computerPresses comment was fairly vague(line 7). We feel like there were some parts of the code that were added as quick bugfixes, which causes the overall code to be a bit messy. We are also confused about the necessity for some of the classes but we are sure that the more we dive into this project, the more we'll understand their importance. There are some syntax issues, which can be attributed to usage of different text editors but for the most part, the code is nicely organized.

Test Coverage:
There are JUnit tests present in SimonSaysTest.java. From a first look, it looks like the tests are extensive however, we don't think there is enough because the game is freezing after three games are played on it. We need to make more test cases to address this issue.
