a. This is a simon says game. Colored buttons flash in a certain sequence and one must replicate that sequence. The game is over when a sequence is inaccurately replicated. 

b.
 
* as a user I can click on the new game button so that I can selected the game mode I want to play. 

* as a user I can click on a game mode (amateur, intermediate, or professional) button to start playing the game. 

* as a user I can click on the rules button to view the rules of the game.

* as a user I can click on the high scores button to view the high scores for each game mode. 


c. Yes, the program compiles and runs. When we run the program, a frame with four buttons pops up on the screen. There are three buttons: new game, rules, high scores, and exit. They all work fine. One can play games in all modes. When one starts playing the game the squares flash in a particular sequence and one can click on the squares to replicate the sequence. 

d. 

* as a user I can add sound to make the game more fun

* as a user I can select the number of shapes we want in the game so that I can make the game more challenging for myself

* as a user I can change the shape colors so to make it more interesting  

* as a user I can change the shapes so that I do not get tired of seeing the same old squares. 

e. Certain things in the description of the project are inaccurate. For instance, when one clicks the new game button one does not directly start a new game of amateur level. Instead after clicking new game one has to choose the version. Also there is no choose version button anymore. Other than that the README.md is in good quality. It describes how the game works and the purpose of every class. 

f. The build file need a jar target and description. Also a descrition needs to be added to the javadoc target. 

g. Yes there are enough issues to earn 1000 points in this project, the sum of the issue's point values sums up to 1550. All issues are clear in indicating what needs to be done.

i. The code is organized well. The readme has good descriptions of the purpose of each class. however, inside each file, it is unclear what some of the functions are meant for, only about half of the files have comments throughout the code and some of the comments are kind of vague and not fully descriptive. The code is neatly organized which makes it easier to understand. I would recommend reading through the readme to begin understanding how all the code is connected.

j. There are only about 13 junit test, considering that there are more than 13 classes in this project, 13 test is not enough and definitely needs to be worked on.
